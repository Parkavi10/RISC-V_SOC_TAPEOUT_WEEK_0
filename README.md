# 🖥️ SoC Design Progress

This repository documents my **Week 0 tasks and learnings** as I progress through the SoC design program, from RTL all the way to GDSII, using open-source EDA tools.

## 📌 Week 0 — Setup & Tools

| Task   | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| [Task 0](#) | ⚙️ Installed **Icarus Verilog, Yosys, and GTKWave** | ✅ Done |

---

### 🔑 Key Takeaways  

- **SoC Design Flow** – Learned the complete journey from **system specifications (C model)** → **RTL design (Verilog)** → **synthesis to gate-level netlists, macros, and analog IPs** → **SoC integration** → **RTL2GDS flow** leading to the final **GDSII** for fabrication.  
- **End-to-End Understanding** – Understood how an SoC goes from abstract models to a fabricated chip, ultimately powering real-world products like **smartwatches, Arduino boards, TV panels, and AC controllers**.

### ✅ WEEK 0 ACTIVITIES

- Successfully installed all required open-source tools.
- Working environment set up for simulation and synthesis.
- System is now ready for further design flow experiments.
